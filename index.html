      <p class="panel-text">
        Pwnadelphia is a fictional city built to be <strong>vulnerable on purpose</strong>.
        Think: a Wild West version of Philly where every bar, bank, and back alley
        is a lesson in bad security choices.
      </p>
      <p class="panel-text">
        The goal isn't crime. The goal is education:
        learn to <strong>find</strong> bugs, <strong>exploit</strong> them in a safe sandbox,
        and <strong>understand</strong> how to fix them in the real world.
